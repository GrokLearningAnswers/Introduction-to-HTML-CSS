<p><strong>HELENA:</strong> Ay, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,<br>
  Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,<br>
  Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up-<br>
  This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.<br></p>

<p>If you have any pity, grace, or manners,<br>
  You would not make me such an argument.<br>
  But fare ye well. 'Tis partly my own fault,<br>
  Which death or absence soon shall remedy.<br></p>

<p><strong>LYSANDER:</strong> Stay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse.<br>
  My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!<br></p>

<p><strong>HELENA:</strong> Oh, excellent!<br></p>

<p><strong>HERMIA <em>(to LYSANDER)</em>:</strong> Sweet, do not scorn her so.<br></p>

<p><strong>DEMETRIUS:</strong> If she cannot entreat, I can compel.<br></p>

<p><strong>LYSANDER:</strong> Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.<br>
  Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.-<br>
  Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do.<br>
  I swear by that which I will lose for thee<br>
  To prove him false that says I love thee not.<br></p>

<p><strong>DEMETRIUS:</strong> I say I love thee more than he can do.<br></p>
<p><strong>LYSANDER:</strong> If thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.</p>

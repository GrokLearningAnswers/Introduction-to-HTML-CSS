    <h2>Stunning Rainbow in Sydney!</h2>

    <p>The storm clouds parted and Sydney was greeted by a spectacular double rainbow. Social media exploded in response, as people rushed to share their photos online.</p>
    <p>Professor Blaggins from the School of Physics at the University of Argleton said that "double rainbows are caused by a double reflection of sunlight inside the raindrops.</p>
    <p>"The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light is absorbed from two reflections compared to one, and the secondary rainbow is spread over more of the sky".</p>
    <p>If you've taken a great photo of a rainbow here in Argleton, send it in to <a href="#">readers@argletonadvertiser.co.uk</a>.</p>

<h1>Argleton</h1>

<p>Argleton was a phantom settlement that appeared on Google Maps but does not actually exist. The supposed location of Argleton was within the civil parish of Aughton in West Lancashire, England, which in reality is nothing more than empty fields.</p>

<p>Data from Google are used by other online information services which consequently treated Argleton as a real settlement. As a result, Argleton also appeared in numerous listings for things such as real estate, employment and weather.</p>


<h2>Media interest</h2>

<p>The anomaly was first noticed by Mike Nolan, head of web services at nearby Edge Hill University, who posted about it on his blog in September 2008. The story was later picked up by the local media and By November 2009, news of the non-existent town had received global media attention, and "Argleton" became a popular hashtag on Twitter.</p>


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<p>One possible explanation for the presence of Argleton is that it was added deliberately as a copyright trap, or "paper town" as they are sometimes known, to catch any violations of copyright.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it has been suggested that "Argleton" is merely a misspelling of "Aughton", although both names appear on the map. Professor Danny Dorling, president of the Society of Cartographers, considered it more likely that Argleton was nothing more than an "innocent mistake".</p>
